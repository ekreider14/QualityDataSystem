This readme refers to unit testing within the application. 

All functions and programability are executed through the web program and are currently done by hand.
There are tests to ensure the different systems are communicating, but individual functions should be 
tested manually for the time being. 

Each account has specific functions they have access to since data is intentionally limited to those 
who need it. As such, the only account that has access to everything it the ITAdmin account, which 
exists partially to validate that the system is functioning as expected. For manual validation, 
currently this is the best approach. This task might be automated in the future.
